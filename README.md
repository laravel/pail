## Introduction

Laravel Pail is a package that allows you to easily dive into your Laravel application's log files directly from the command line. Unlike other log tailing packages, Pail is designed to work with any log driver, including [Sentry](https://sentry.io) or [Flare](https://flareapp.io).

In addition, Pail focuses on the developer experience: it provides a sleek CLI interface with a user-friendly design and a set of useful filters to help you find what you're looking for.
